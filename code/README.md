## I did not create this program. The edits I have made are listed below, and I have received the permission of its creator and other editors to add it to this repo to have all do it yourself B0XX information in one place, for the purpose of organization.

This utilize the Nicohood Library. This were originally made by simple to make a Smashbox. Snapple and then Danny modified this code to work with the B0XX's two modifiers and to try and abide by the parameters set in the B0XX manifesto.

I then modified aspects of that code to make it function in Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate.
## I have combined the Melee and Smash4/Ultimate code, so you don't have to keep swapping profiles.
 *  To launch in Melee mode, just plug in normally.
 *  To launch in Smash4/Ultimate mode, hold Start and B while plugging in.
 
 *    To tell if you are using the correct mode in Ultimate, with tap jump on

     if you press mod1 and up
     
       if you are on Ultimate mode
     
         you will not jump
       
       if you are on Melee mode
         
         you will jump


 *    To tell if you are using the correct mode in Melee,

    Press mod1, down, and B
    
    if you are on Melee mode
      
      you will down b
    
    if you are on Ultimate mode
      
      you will neutral b  

 *  If you are in the wrong mode, you can either unplug and try again, or you can use this button combonation to switch modes mid game.  
 `    Down+Right+Mod1+B+X+A`
 *  If using the standard B0XX layout, this is both hands index/middle fingers and thumbs

## Edits made for the Smash4/Ultimate mode
 * Mods + cardinals, tilts, triggers(shields), and most firefox angles edited.
 * Mods walk speeds are likely not optimal. Notably though, right/left + mod1 gives perfect speed to ledgerun in smash4.
 * Tilts now work with mod1.
 * Triggers now give the analog value needed to shield in smash4/Ultimate. LRAStart now works too because of this
 * FFox angles (B0XX method, c stick) now almost work properly. Mod1+diagonal+cright/left do not work in Smash4, but do in Ultimate. C stickless firefox angles function now, but not perfectly.
