#### This program was originally made by simple. The edits I have made are listed below, and I have received the permission of its creator and other editors to add it to this repo.

This utilizes the Nicohood Library. This were originally made by simple to make a Smashbox. Snapple and then Danny modified this code to work with the B0XX's two modifiers and to try and abide by the parameters set in the B0XX manifesto.

I then modified aspects of that code to make it function in Project M, Smash 4, Smash Ultimate, and to have 2ip as a SOCD option.
# My Edits
## 2ip or Neutral SOCD
I have edited the left/right simultaneous opposite cardinal directions (SOCD) so you now have the option to pick from 2ip or neutral.

#### 2ip works like this
* Press left. Character moves left.
* While still pressing left, press right. Character moves right.
* While still pressing left, stop pressing right. Character moves left again.

#### Neutral works like this
* Press left. Character moves left.
* While still pressing left, press right. Character stops moving.
* While still pressing left, stop pressing right. Character moves left again.

The official B0XX uses 1ip for its SOCD method. 1ip is the same as 2ip, but the third step does not occur, meaning that you need to press left again to go left.

I plan to implement 1ip SOCD as an option soon.

## I have combined my Melee, Project M, and Smash4/Ultimate edits, so you don't have to keep swapping profiles.
 *  To launch in Melee mode, just plug in normally.
 *  To launch in Smash4/Ultimate mode, hold B while plugging in.
 *  To launch in Project M mode, hold X while plugging in.

 Be sure to do a button check before starting a set, to confirm you are in the right mode.

 If mod1+up makes you jump, or if mod1+down+B makes you neutral B, you are in the wrong mode. Check both of these.

## Edits made for the Project M mode
 *  Tilts, firefox angles, shield drop angles (Axe method), and wavedash angles all fixed.
 *  Fixed bug where left and down were not working on SSS and menus.

## Edits made for the Smash4/Ultimate mode
 * Mods + cardinals, tilts, triggers(shields), and most firefox angles edited.
 * Mods change running/walking speed. Direction, then mod1 gives perfect speed to ledgerun in smash4.
 * Tilts now work with mod1.
 * Triggers now give the analog value needed to shield in smash4/Ultimate. LRAStart now works too because of this.
 * FFox angles (B0XX method, c stick) now almost work properly. Mod1+diagonal+cright/left do not work in Smash4, but do in Ultimate.
 * C stickless firefox angles function now.

All the names above are the Discord names of users in the 20XX Discord, where the original code was shared.
