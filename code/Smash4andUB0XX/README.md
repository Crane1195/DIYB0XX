My changes to make this work in Smash4 and Ultimate

    Mod running, tilts, triggers(shields), and most firefox angles edited.
    Mods change running/walking speed, they likely aren't optimal. Notably though, right/left, then mod1 gives perfect speed to ledgerun in smash4.
    Tilts now work with mod1.
    Triggers now give the analog value needed to shield in smash4/ultimate. LRAStart now works too because of this
    FFox angles (b0xx method, c stick) now almost work properly. only mod1+diagonal+cright/left do not work (in smash 4, not Ultimate). Can't figure out why. C stickless firefox angles function now, but not perfectly.
