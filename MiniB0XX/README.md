### I did not design the files found in this folder. They were made by simple, and I have received his permission to add them to this repo to have all do it yourself B0XX information in one place, for the purpose of organization.

### I did edit his files to add support for detachable cables. These edits are found in the Detachable MiniB0XX folder.

The MiniB0XX is a 11.5" by 8" shrunk version of the B0XX designed by simple to be 3D printed.

The files in the folder "Original MiniB0XX" are the printable STL files posted by simple in the 20XX discord in DIY #resources

The files in the folder "Detatchable MiniB0XX" are edits I made to the original to allow for detatchable cables with Neutrik passthroughs.
