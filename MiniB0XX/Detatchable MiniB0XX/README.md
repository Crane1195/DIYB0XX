## Disclaimer, I have not printed these edited versions of the MiniB0XX, as I do not have a 3d printer. The holes I made in it in theory should work, as they match up exactly to the product pages diagrams, but I cannot confirm with 100% certainty that these designs are flawless. If you end up printing one, let me know if the holes fit the passthroughs.

When printing these,

    Print outsides facing on bed so you get a glossy face plate and backplate.
    Uses #6 Countersunk Flat head screws 3/4".
    Design is in inches, so make sure you convert to 2540% scale if using mm.

I converted simples stl files for the MiniB0XX to ipt files, and then edited those to have holes for Neutrik passthroughs. These ipt files are found in .ipts

The Neutrik passthroughs on the MiniB0XX allow for a detatchable RJ45 male to Gamecube male cable and/or an external usb port to connect to the arduino for updating software.

The folder Both contains the stl files for having both ports, and the JustRJ45/JustUSB folders have the files for just one port.

For JustRJ45, you will have to open the MiniB0XX up to change the software

For JustUSB, you will have a non detatchable Gamecube cable.

For more information regarding how to make a RJ45 male to Gamecube male cable and how to use one in a DIYB0XX, stay tuned to DIYB0XX/MiniAluminum , as I have that setup in my new B0XX, and will soon be showing how it works.
