# Required Parts / Tools

- OEM Gamecube Controller Cable OR Gamecube extension cable
    - If you have a broken Gamecube controller for parts, you can harvest its cable and use that. Otherwise, a Gamecube extension cable will work. If you have neither, a broken gamecube controller costs much more, but its cable is guaranteed to be high quality, as it is OEM. An extension cable is much cheaper (talking ~$15 dollars compared to ~$3), but some of them are not high quality.
    - I made two from Kitsch-Bent extension cables and they work perfectly. Here is a link to them, select NGC from the drop down menu. They only cost $2.50, and shipping is ~$5.00, so I got multiple.

- Wire stripper. This is used to remove the protective outer shell of the Gamecube cable.
    - The 8/10 gauge cutter on mine was used
WIP. Will finish later today
