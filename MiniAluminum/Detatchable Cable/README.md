Here you will find all the information needed to make a detatchable cable for a custom Gamecube controller/fightstick.

## Required Parts / Tools

- OEM Gamecube Controller Cable OR Gamecube extension cable
    - If you have a broken Gamecube controller for parts, you can harvest its cable and use that. Otherwise, a Gamecube extension cable will work. If you have neither, a broken gamecube controller costs much more, but its cable is guaranteed to be high quality, as it is OEM. An extension cable is much cheaper (talking ~$15 dollars compared to ~$3), but some of them are not high quality.
    - I made two from Kitsch-Bent extension cables and they work perfectly. Here is a link to them, select NGC from the drop down menu. They only cost $2.50, and shipping is ~$5.00, so I got multiple.

- Wire stripper. This is used to remove the protective outer shell of the Gamecube cable.
    - The 8/10 gauge cutter on mine was used

- RJ45 Crimp Kit
    - Here's the kit I used. This comes with both the crimping tool, and the connectors.

- Neutrik NE8FDP
    - This is the female connector, that gets installed in the case of the fightstick. Comes in black and silver. Here's a link to the black one I use
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BEWOYI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

- Neutrik NE8MC
    - This is the male connector, that is installed around the custom cable. The cable works without this, but this makes it much more durable and secure. Also comes in black and silver. Here's a link to the black one I use
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BEWKR4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

- Multimeter
    - If you are not using an OEM Gamecube controller cable, to be safe, you will need to check which wire is which signal. I will post what my wires are below, so if you use a Kitsch Bent extension, they will likely be the same, but not necessarily. It is possible that they change their supplier which changes the wiring.
    
## Making the Cable

1. Cut the female end off of the extension cable, or take apart a Gamecube Controller and cut the cable as close to its connector as possible.

2. Strip off the ~ 1 cm of the outer shell. The wires here are too long, so I trimmed them down to as long as seen below, using a wire cutter.

3. Flatten all the wires in a way that makes them the least strained.
