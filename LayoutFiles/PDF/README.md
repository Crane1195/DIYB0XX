# PDF Layouts

All full layout PDFs are scaled to be 17" x 11", and the PDFs that are split into right and left halfs are scaled to be 8.5" x 11".

If you need to scale them to another size, I would recommend the free program GIMP. It lets you import PDFs, and you can change the canvas size to be whatever you need.
