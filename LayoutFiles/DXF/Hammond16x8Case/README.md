# Hammond 16" x 8" Steel Case

This is a case I have recommended for a while now and is one a lot of people use. It is a 16" x 8" x 2" steel case with an open top that you could screw a switch plate onto.

The model number is 1441-26BK3, and it's available on many sites such as Digikey, Mouser, and Arrow. I would recommend shopping around to find whichever is cheapest at the time.
