# Layout Files

I've made a lot of layout files over time and figured it would make sense to compile some of the useful ones here. Let me know if you interested in any other layout files, I might have made them already and I can add them here.

The PDF folder is for people who want to print the layout to use as a template.

The DXF folder is for people who want to modify the layouts, or get them laser cut.
