## Crane's DIY B0XX

![image](https://i.imgur.com/nWhepdX.jpg)

First, credit where credit is due. The B0XX is a product that will be brought to market soonâ„¢ by:

Hax$ (https://twitter.com/ssbmhax)

Streamlord (https://twitter.com/StreamlordSSBM)

SimpleControllers(https://github.com/SimpleControllers)

And possibly more people that I am forgetting currently. Their website, where the B0XX is now available to preorder http://b0xx.com/


Here you can find the B0XX manifesto explaining how the B0XX attempts to be in line with the gamecube controller for SSBM, as well as the 20XX community Discord where you can keep up to date with the progress of the B0XX development, as well as ask questions to Streamlord or Simple about the B0XX, or myself (Crane) and others any DIY questions.

Here's the Discord invite link https://discord.gg/6wcEaDU

Huge shout out to Simple for his excellent guide detailing how to DIY a smashbox found here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndV4E_w2ThAv9LpbjEzRDWwMj0uBWB9YqbvkHV35X5w/edit

His guide is an incredible resource for how the wiring works.

Also, a shout out to to Snapple and Danny who modified Simples Smashbox arduino code to be accurate to the B0XX manifesto and work with the B0XX's 2 modifiers, found here. I further modified this code with a few tweaks to make it function for Smash4 and Smash Ultimate.

Anyway, enough of the intro, lets get into the build.

For a joke, I made the greatest piece of tech that the world has ever seen with the shoeb0xx, which you can see the build of here

Pictured is the wood used to create a more sturdy B0XX. For a thinner, more slim B0XX, you could use metal, plastic, plexi, or plywood for the top, but I wanted a sturdy platform so I used 0.75 inch thick wood, as I don't have the tools to work with metal, plastic, etc. The actual size of the B0XX is 16" x 8" x 1.4", however I could not find a piece of wood exactly 8 inches, with the closest I found being 9.75". I don't have a saw that can make the cut, so I stuck with the 9.75" depth. I don't mind it, as I can use the extra depth to rest my wrists.

Cut the wood to about the correct size using a compound miter saw.

Using wood glue, and clamps, I joined the sides together.

Testing the fit of the top with the curing walls

Glued the top to the walls, and applied tons of pressure using clamps, and some textbooks to join the wood.

The only picture I could find of the finished pure wooden B0XX, with the dween that just showed up.

Heres a link to the template I used. Print the document on 8.5"x11" paper, and cut along the lines, to get your 8"x16" template.

Taped the template to my B0XX, marking with a thumbtack.

Cut a piece of 2' x 2' piece of plywood to be the bottom. As I write this, the paint is drying on the bottom. Did this last.

Painted the top, and sides using multiple layers of spraypaint, and then brushed on 3 layers of minwax polycrylic to make it smoother and a bit more protected.

Next up was the internals. Here you can see the OBSF24 Blues, and the cables I spliced together to connect the buttons to the dween. Bought a pack of 10 double ended cables with .110" QCD's, cut them in half, and spliced them to jumper cables that I also cut in half, soldering and heatshrinking them. Also pictured is a gamecube controller cable that I desoldered from a dead GCC I bought from ebay.

Wiring is messy since I made the cables much longer than they need to be unfortunately. I used a common groundcable with 30 .110" connectors, a 5v to 3.3v converter, and a common ground / 5V panel from another project I did. For more info on how the wiring works, check out Simple's guide linked above, message me on Discord, or join the 20XX Discord from the link above. @Crane#1195 is my ID

First time testing it with my GC! Works flawlessly.

The color scheme was done to match my mechanical keyboard.

Immediately after drilling a 3/8 inch hole for the dweens USB port, I remembered that I have a jigsaw. Used a knife to square it out a bit so the usb could fit, but it isn't as clean as a jigsaw could've been.

Here is an extensive part list I made to track how much I spent but I thought I'd share.

Once again, huge thanks to Simple for his guide, and assistance when I had a couple of roadblocks, as well as Hax, and Streamlord. We are all on the Discord which can be found at http://b0xx.com/ (or above) if you have any questions, or want to keep up with the actual B0XX's development.
