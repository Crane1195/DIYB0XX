First, credit where credit is due. The B0XX is a product that will be brought to market soonâ„¢ by:

Hax$ (https://twitter.com/ssbmhax)

Streamlord (https://twitter.com/StreamlordSSBM)

SimpleControllers(https://github.com/SimpleControllers)

And possibly more people that I am forgetting currently. Their website, where the B0XX is now available to preorder http://b0xx . com/


Here you can find the B0XX manifesto explaining how the B0XX attempts to be in line with the gamecube controller for SSBM, as well as the 20XX community discord where you can keep up to date with the progress of the B0XX development, as well as ask questions to Streamlord or Simple about the B0XX, or myself (Crane) and others any DIY questions.

Huge shout out to Simple for his excellent guide detailing how to DIY a smashbox found here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndV4E_w2ThAv9LpbjEzRDWwMj0uBWB9YqbvkHV35X5w/edit

His guide is an incredible resource for how the wiring works.

Also, a shout out to to Snapple and Danny who modified Simples Smashbox arduino code to be accurate to the B0XX manifesto and work with the B0XX's 2 modifiers, found here. I further modified this code with a few tweaks to make it function for Smash4 and Smash Ultimate.

Anyway, enough of the intro, lets get into the build.
