First, credit where credit is due. The B0XX is a product that will be brought to market soonâ„¢ by:

Hax$ (https://twitter.com/ssbmhax)

Streamlord (https://twitter.com/StreamlordSSBM)

SimpleControllers(https://github.com/SimpleControllers)

And possibly more people that I am forgetting currently. Their website, where the B0XX is now available to preorder http://b0xx . com/


Here you can find the B0XX manifesto explaining how the B0XX attempts to be in line with the gamecube controller for SSBM, as well as the 20XX community discord where you can keep up to date with the progress of the B0XX development, as well as ask questions to Streamlord or Simple about the B0XX, or myself (Crane) and others any DIY questions.

Huge shout out to Simple for his excellent guide detailing how to DIY a smashbox found here

His guide is an incredible resource for how the wiring works.

Also, a shout out to to Snapple and Danny who modified Simples Smashbox arduino code to be accurate to the B0XX manifesto and work with the B0XX's 2 modifiers, found here. I further modified this code with a few tweaks to make it function for Smash4 and Smash Ultimate.

Anyway, enough of the intro, lets get into the build.

For a joke, I made the greatest piece of tech that the world has ever seen with the shoeb0xx, which you can see the build of here

Pictured is the wood used to create a more sturdy B0XX. For a thinner, more slim B0XX, you could use metal, plastic, plexi, or plywood for the top, but I wanted a sturdy platform so I used 0.75 inch thick wood, as I don't have the tools to work with metal, plastic, etc. The actual size of the B0XX is 16" x 8" x 1.4", however I could not find a piece of wood exactly 8 inches, with the closest I found being 9.75". I don't have a saw that can make the cut, so I stuck with the 9.75" depth. I don't mind it, as I can use the extra depth to rest my wrists.
