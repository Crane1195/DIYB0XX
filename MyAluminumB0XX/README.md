While my first DIY B0XX project was functional, it had room for improvement. This time, I have chosen to purchase an aluminum case from Digikey to use as the chassis, and I have drawn a face plate, which was laser cut out of acrylic from Pololu. The prefab aluminum case was chosen to make all three dimensions smaller. It is much more portable now as a result. The acrylic button plate was chosen to make all holes evenly spaced, and to have a much smoother finish than wood coated in polycrylic.

On top of this, I have done two modifications to the design which increase overall functionality.
