The B0XX is a controller designed for Super Smash Brothers Melee, with ergonomics being the number one priority. It is

While my first DIY B0XX project was functional, it had room for improvement. This time, I have chosen to purchase an aluminum case from Digikey to use as the chassis, and I have drawn a face plate, which was laser cut out of acrylic from Pololu. The prefab aluminum case was chosen to make all three dimensions smaller. It is much more portable now as a result. The laser cut acrylic plate has perfectly spaced holes, and is much smoother than the wood coated in polycrylic.

On top of this, I have done two modifications to the design which increase overall functionality.

The first of which a detachable RJ45 to Gamecube cable, and the second is an internal Gamecube to USB adapter with the extra three ports available to use outside the case.

## Components

### Aluminum Case

The case used for this build is a 12" x 8" x 2" aluminum prefab that I ordered from Digikey.

This case's edges are pretty sharp, the holes on mine did not match up exactly to its datasheet, and it got pretty scratched up while I was modding it, but it is pretty decent for the price of ~$40 dollars shipped.

A bit of sanding solves the sharp edges.

I highly reccomend measuring the holes on your unit if you are making a panel for the top like I did. I might have been unlucky, and they usually are up to spec with the datasheet, but it might be normal.

It comes with an adhesive protective film on all sides if I recall correctly. Leave these on the case while working on it.

They also make a similar case to this one, but in a 16" x 8" x 2" form factor. The larger size comes in both aluminum

and steel

I have not used the steel variant, but I would imagine it would be more scratch resistant and probably stronger.

### Detachable RJ45 to GCC Cable
This is a massive upgrade over the attached cable used previously. Besides the fact that the cable I used was in bad shape and from a beat up OEM controller I found on eBay, an attached cable does not really have anywhere to go outside of a box controller. Wrapping it around damages the cable, and it makes the controller much more of a hassle to travel with. To see how this cable is made, check out this guide I wrote on the topic https://github.com/Crane1195/DIYB0XX/tree/master/Detachable%20Cable

### Internal GCC to USB adapter
This is an interesting addition that could be quite useful for some people, but I am not really one of them. Basically, you solder wires to the pads of a GC port on a Gamecube to USB adapter, and route those to the same lines of your normal GCC cable. What this means is that you can use the controller like a normal Gamecube controller with the RJ45 to GCC cable, or you can plug the GC adapters USB cable into a Switch/WiiU/PC to avoid using an external controller adapter.
