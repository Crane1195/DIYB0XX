A 12" x 8" B0XX layout that I drew in Autodesk Inventor. Has holes for connecting it to the aluminum case.

This can be printed to use as a template for a drill press, or used with a laser cutter.

I sent this file to be laser cut by Pololu, whose service you can find here

This is a layout made by Streamlord where you hold the B0XX like a guitar (see https://twitter.com/Streamlord20XX/status/1015047978841600001).

The DWG file can be used to make edits, or to be laser cut by Pololu.

The PDF file can be printed at a 1:1 scale on standard printer paper (8.5 x 11) and used with a hand drill or drill press.
