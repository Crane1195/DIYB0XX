I among others wanted to try this layout for before the product launches, so many including me have created a B0XX from raw materials, prefabricated cases, arcade hardware, and arduinos.

I first created a B0XX using wood, which you can see the process of in the MyWoodB0XX folder, but did not like the feeling of its surface and its large size.

I have now made one in a much smaller aluminum case that I purchased from Digikey, and have had an acrylic panel laser cut with the layout I drew in Autodesk Inventor. This one is currently a work in progress, and is almost complete. This process and increased functionality will soon be detailed in the MyAluminumB0XX folder.

The MiniB0XX folder contains files pertaining to a 3d printable case that is similar in size and potential functionality to my Aluminum B0XX. 

The code folder includes the most up to date software for flashing to an arduino, with profiles for both Smash Melee, and Smash4/Ultimate, and information regarding how to set it up, and who all contributed.

If sharing any of the files/information found here, give credit to their original creators.
